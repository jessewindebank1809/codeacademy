JSX syntax extension for React

Javascrip is case sensitive

ReactDOM is the name of a JavaScript library. This library contains several React-specific methods, all of which deal with the DOM in some way or another.

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Render me!</h1>, document.getElementById('app'));
First express should always be JSX expression

Everything within {} will be treated as JavaScript

If statement will break JSX expression

const img = <img src={pics[coinToss() === 'heads' ? 'kitty' : 'doggy']} />;

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <RedPanda />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
