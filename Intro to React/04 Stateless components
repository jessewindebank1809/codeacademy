Stateful vs Stateless:
Stateful is a component that includes a state property
Stateless is a component that does not include a state property

stateful component:
class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Frarthur'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return <div></div>;
  }
}

stateless component:
export class Child extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hey, my name is {this.props.name}!</h1>
  }
}

A React component should use props to store information that can be changed, but can only be changed by a different component.

A React component should use state to store information that the component itself can change.
