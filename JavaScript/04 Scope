// Introduction:

An important idea in programming is scope. Scope defines where variables can be accessed or referenced. While some variables can be accessed from anywhere within a program, other variables may only be available in a specific context.

You can think of scope like the view of the night sky from your window. Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the stars. The stars are accessible globally. Meanwhile, if you live in a city, you may see the city skyline or the river. The skyline and river are only accessible locally in your city, but you can still see the stars that are available globally.

Too many global variables can cause scope polution and take up all the space within the global namespace
Its best to declare variables within each block code instead of at a global level

let variablename declares inital variable to reassign new value drop the let
